	 My name is Archana and I graduated from the Honours Life Sciences Program at McMaster University. During my undergrad I was interested in digital healthcare and how to improve healthcare through implenting technology. This led me to currently enrol in the MHI program at Uoft!

	 In my free time I enjoy listening to music and watching Netflix. I prefer to marathon a finished TV show, than wait weekly. 
	<br/> 
	<br/> 
	I also picked up on trying new recipies during the pandemic, thanks to quick cooking tutorials on TikTok!
	<br/>
	<br/> 
	But I think I enjoy travelling and taking pictures is my most favourite hobby. In my Photography tab, you will see a glimpse of the pictures I took! See you there :)
